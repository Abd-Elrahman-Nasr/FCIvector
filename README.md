# FCIvector
##### 12-2019

A c++ library used to create any vector regardless the data type, using dynamic allocation of memory


## FCIvector Library
FCIvector.h and FCIvector.cpp are the library files
*main.c is just an interface for using the library and making sure everything works fine through a simple list of optons*

## Technologies
a numerous of technologies and concepts were implemented such as:
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Pointers
- Templates
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Operators overloading

## Main
a user-friendly Command Line Interface (CLI) to test the library capabilities as showcases of the library flexibility

*NOTE:* the code was implemented manually from scratch as part of my programming-2 (OOP) assignment in college
